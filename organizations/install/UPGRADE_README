****  UPGRADING FROM CORAL ORGANIZATIONS VERSION 1.0 TO 1.1
****
****
**************************************************************************************************

This upgrade contains coding and database structure changes only.  No changes to the configuration file are required.

Database changes include:
    * Adding address field to contact and removing state and country fields
    * Update the address field to contain the previously used state and country data
    * Add view account tab indicator to User (for a future code-only upgrade)



For manual installation, you will need to first modify the upgrade_1_1.sql script located in this directory to replace _DATABASE_NAME_ with your MySQL schema name (e.g. coral_organizations_pprd).
Next, run the upgrade_1_1.sql script in your MySQL client.

The MySQL workbench and data model have both been updated with this upgrade.
